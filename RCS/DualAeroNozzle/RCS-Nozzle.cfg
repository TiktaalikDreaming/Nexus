description = Not at all an old mono-RCS thruster block that someone's drilled out new sections and added fuel to.  Requires a supply of Fuel and Oxydizer.  As such, it provides considerably more thrust than the monopropellant version (yay flame!), which is handy when you're trying to turn a thousand tonnes of steel and nuke. Peeling off the labels to expose prior manufacturer's logo will void the warranty.
