	description = A massive 70 foot diameter liquid Hydrogen tank for use in a second stage of the Nexus.  This would be sufficient to get pretty much anywhere in the solar system.  Based on Convair diagram 3.2.2-3 GCR (2@3000k) Nuclear Stage (P/S-B-LV 3.2-GCR 2@3000K) from the left hand side of page 100 of APR eV3N1. Expectation would be a double 3k Gas Core Rocket for power.
