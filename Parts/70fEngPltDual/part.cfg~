	description = When nobody believed in (or even asked for) an even larger fuel tank than the already enormous S3-7200, Kerbodyne stepped up with the sanity-defying S3-14400 model. Carrying fully twice as much fuel as before, this fuel tank may just pack enough propellant to justify its proportionately enormous cost.
