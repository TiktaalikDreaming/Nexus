	description = While based loosely on aerobrakes, these large flaps are not actually intended to slow the descent of the recoverable Nexus booster.  As the booster stage is not a self-stabilising shape, the flaps are to maintain the facing so that the heat shield takes the main impact of aerodynamic heating.
