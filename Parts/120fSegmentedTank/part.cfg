	title = Liquid Hydrogen 120 foot Segmented Tank for Second Stage Interplanetary
	manufacturer = Konvair division of Kerbal Dynamics
	description = In case the 70 foot tanks aren't big enough, Konvair has a 120 foot tank that's been segmented to provide the required structural integrity.  This monster will typically need more than a base Nexus to loft it into orbit.  The notes suggest 44.5 Million pound thrust for the first stage, rather than then 32 that's normal for a nexus.  So, either lots more control rockets, or dramatic amounts of solid boosters.  Or just the Nexus 2, with it's 64 million pounds thrust (Nexus-2 coming this summer).  Based on Nexus design P/S-C-LV 3.2.
