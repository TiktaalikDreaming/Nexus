	description = A massive 70 foot diameter liquid Hydrogen tank for use in a second stage of the Nexus.  This would be sufficient to get to most nearby planets in the solar system.  Based on Convair diagram 3.2.2-4 GCR (4000k) Nuclear Stage (P/S-B-LV 3.2-GCR 4000K) from the right hand side of page 100 of APR eV3N1.  Expectation would be a single 4k Gas Core Rocket for power.
